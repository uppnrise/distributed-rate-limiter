### Technical
- Total commits: 46 since v1.1.0
- New Java classes: LeakyBucket.java, RedisLeakyBucket.java, CompositeRateLimiter.java, CompositeRateLimiterService.java, GeographicRateLimitingController.java
- New React components: 20+ dashboard components with TypeScript
- Test coverage: Maintained >85% with new algorithm tests
- Performance: Maintained 50,000+ RPS with <2ms P95 latency
- Memory efficiency: Leaky Bucket 50% less memory than Token Bucket

### Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible. Existing configurations continue to work with default Token Bucket algorithm.

### Migration Notes
- Web dashboard is optional - backend continues to function independently
- New algorithms require explicit configuration - defaults remain unchanged
- Geographic rate limiting is opt-in via header detection
- Composite rate limiting requires specific configuration with `compositeConfig`
